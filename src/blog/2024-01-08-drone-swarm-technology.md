description: Since drones began to gather popularity in the consumer market, drone technology has been improving steadily. Drones can now be used to survey an area, to take aerial photographs and for delivery systems. Drones found a place everywhere between recreational purposes (with drone races) and military combat. To step it up a notch, drones can also be used to create fascinating light shows. The drones are pre-programmed by a central computer to move in specific formations. Combined with their built-in LEDs, they can form stationary pictures or even a flying turtle in the sky! 

But what if we wanted to take it up another notch? How can drone technology be further improved?

Since drones began to gather popularity in the consumer market, drone technology has been improving steadily. Drones can now be used to survey an area, to take aerial photographs and for delivery systems. Drones found a place everywhere between recreational purposes (with drone races) and military combat. To step it up a notch, drones can also be used to create fascinating light shows. The drones are pre-programmed by a central computer to move in specific formations. Combined with their built-in LEDs, they can form stationary pictures or even a flying turtle in the sky! 

But what if we wanted to take it up another notch? How can drone technology be further improved?  

Enter drone swarm technology.  

Imagine a team of 20 drones, each intelligent on its own, but all working together. These drones are capable of obtaining information and sharing it among themselves to work towards a common goal. In other words, each drone is capable of intelligent decision making based on information gathered from the environment all by itself. This opens a world of new uses for drone technology. They can be used to gather data over a large area, and to conduct large-scale inspections to scan and survey land (even through foliage) and detect early signs of wildfires. This can also be extended to search and rescue missions, or even to identify possible threats and then eliminate them. In research facilities, these kinds of drones have even been used to build structures and weave bridges with ropes in somewhat tight environments. Autonomously. They can work together towards predefined tasks and respond to unexpected disturbances. Impressively, they can also be taught to interact with humans they encounter and respond to certain gestures. 

And what happens when these drones are employed for military purposes? Well, they already have. The S.W.A.R.M. stands for Smart War-Fighting Array of Reconfigured Modules. These drones have such huge potential that many consider them to be weapons of mass destruction. A “search and rescue” can easily become an “identify and destroy” mission. And if these drones are equipped with facial recognition models, they can identify and eliminate selected individuals. They can easily overwhelm anti-aircraft defense systems because just how many can we target? 

Be that as it may, drone swarm technology has 2 major bottle-necks. Being light-weight machines, drones cannot carry heavy loads. Their small battery lives also mean that they would need to be charged at very regular intervals. And the more features and sensors the drone has, the heavier it becomes and the more power is needed to run it. These are the most common constraints faced when using drone swarms. But with the rate at which technology advances each day, these problems might be surmounted as early as tomorrow morning. 

Improvements in drone technology bring with them a potential for positive development and also for dangerous usage in the hands of the wrong people. So what do you think? Is this development for the better? Or worse?
