Aerospace always seems like an extremely complex and far off topic. Maybe it’s because most people see it as “rocket science”. Well, those people aren’t wrong, but this rocket science is used in many parts of our lives. Heck, I bet you use aerospace technology everyday. So what exactly does it mean?  

Well, aerospace simply refers to 2 things: the earth’s atmosphere and outer space. And aerospace engineering builds anything that operates within those regions. This can be as far away as the International Space Station or as close as a drone. A simple way to put it is that aerospace engineering covers everything that flies. So if you have built a paper plane or a kite, congratulations! That’s the first step in understanding aerospace.  

You might not know it, but most parts of our life revolve around aerospace technology. Taking a plane to another state is a classic example, but most cars also use aerospace technology. The GPS that helps you get to your destination, your weather prediction app, and the satellite internet that some of us still use are all provided by a satellite somewhere in space. And let’s not forget those sweet fighter jets too.  

So how did it all start?  

Before we could reach space, we had to first find a way to fly. And so it began with Aeronautics - the study of the science of flight. The first people who  were actually able to fly made use of hot-air balloons. And then, using the concept of kites, gliders were invented. These gliders didn’t have engines. They floated on air currents like flower petals. This of course isn't stable, and it actually killed one of the early glider inventors. There were a few more aviation inventions, and after years of experimenting, the Wright Brothers made the first airplane flight in 1903. It was a legendary flight. It was highly anticipated. It lasted … just 12 seconds.  

But those 12 seconds laid the foundation for modern aeronautics. The airplane still looked like an engine-powered kite, but slowly, engineers began to improve on it till it became the kind of airplane we know and trust today. 
 
After we found that we could fly and travel the atmosphere, why not go further? So Astronautics was born - the study of space travel and exploration. After the Second world war, 2 rivals converted their “ballistic missile race” into a space race. In 1955, the gunshot sounded and the race began between the United States and the Soviet Union: the country with the superior spaceflight mission wins.  

And the winner? It depends on who you ask. The Soviet Union launched the first satellite into space. Sputnik 1 only transmitted for 3 weeks while in space before its batteries died. But in that time, it provided valuable information to assist scientists with the prospect of space travel. And though the US lost the battle of launching the first satellite, they sent the first man safely to the moon. Niel Armstrong became a historical figure in 1969 for the “giant leap for mankind” that this represented in terms of aerospace engineering. The space race eventually ended in a partnership between the 2 countries to work on a few space programs together.  

The aerospace industry was built on years of research, but it stemmed from kites and hot-air balloons. I guess you are wondering "So why is rocket science so hard"? I’ll explain.  
 
On paper, the physics behind aerospace engineering is very complex due to the nature of the forces acting on an object in aerospace. In practice, it becomes even more delicate, and with higher stakes. With millions of parts to account for, there are so many ways things could go wrong. And one small mistake would not only cost hundreds of millions of dollars, but also human lives. In 1986, a space shuttle exploded after flying for just 73 seconds, along with the 7 people in it. The cause? A small circular rubber ring was colder than expected.  

Aerospace engineering is extremely sensitive, but it rests in the hands of trained scientists who continue to make innovations. It has not only taken us to outer space, but also to Mars. We can explore the prospects of life on another planet thanks to aerospace. Our airplanes and drones work because someone was determined to create sustainable flight. The future of aerospace engineering is still being built, and it would rest in the hands of people like me and you, curious to surpass boundaries.  

In the words of Amelia Earhart (an American aviation pioneer), "what do dreams know of boundaries?"
